    "    Logging in Python refers to the process of recording or storing information about the events, activities, and messages that occur during the execution of a program. It allows developers to capture valuable information and data related to the program's behavior, performance, and potential issues. The Python logging module provides a flexible and powerful logging framework to manage and control the generation and handling of log records.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key features of Python's logging module include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Log Levels: Logging allows you to define different levels of severity for log messages, such as DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL. This helps filter and prioritize log messages based on their importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logging to Different Outputs: Python logging can be configured to output log messages to various destinations, such as the console, files, databases, or external services, making it adaptable to different deployment environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Custom Formatting: You can customize the format of log messages to include relevant information like timestamps, log levels, module names, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Loggers and Handlers: The logging module allows you to create multiple loggers, each with its own configuration, and you can attach multiple handlers to each logger, determining where the log messages are sent.\n",

    "The importance of logging in software development:\n",
    "\n",
    "Debugging and Troubleshooting: Logging helps developers trace the flow of execution, identify issues, and understand the program's behavior. It is invaluable during debugging and diagnosing problems in production environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Monitoring and Performance Analysis: Logging provides insights into the performance of the software, helping developers identify bottlenecks and optimize the code for better efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Auditing and Compliance: In some applications, logging is necessary for auditing and compliance requirements, as it maintains a record of critical actions or events.\n",

    "Error Reporting and Analytics: By logging errors and exceptions, developers can collect valuable data to improve the reliability and user experience of the software.\n",

    "9 What is the difference between the logging and print statements in Python? When\n",
    "should you use logging over print statements in a real-world application?\n",
    "ANS:\n",
    "    The logging module and print statements in Python are both used to output information during program execution, but they serve different purposes and have different features:\n",
    "\n",
    "Output Destination:\n",
    "\n",
    "print: The print statement simply outputs text to the standard output, usually the console. It is primarily used for temporary and simple debugging purposes.\n",
    "logging: The logging module provides more control over where log messages are sent. Log messages can be directed to various outputs, such as the console, log files, databases, or external logging services. This flexibility allows developers to manage and analyze logs more effectively.\n",
    "Level of Control:\n",
    "\n",
    "print: print statements are typically used for quick and temporary debugging. Once the debugging phase is over, the print statements may need to be removed or commented out to avoid cluttering the codebase.\n",
    "logging: The logging module allows developers to define different log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) to control the verbosity of logs. This means you can keep detailed log messages during development and reduce them in production environments. Logging can be easily enabled or disabled without modifying the codebase.\n",
    "Log Levels and Filtering:\n",
    "\n",
    "print: print statements are always active unless explicitly removed. They don't offer built-in log levels, so all messages are treated equally.\n",
    "logging: The logging module allows you to set different log levels for different parts of the code. You can log messages at different levels and configure the logging system to record only messages with a certain log level or higher. This helps in filtering and prioritizing log messages based on their importance.\n",
    "Flexibility and Formatting:\n",
    "\n",
    "print: print statements have limited formatting options and often require string concatenation or conversion for complex output.\n",
    "logging: The logging module provides flexible log message formatting with placeholders that can be replaced dynamically. This makes it easier to include additional context in log messages, such as timestamps, log levels, and module names.\n",
    "When to use logging over print statements in a real-world application:\n",
    "\n",
    "Debugging and Development: During development and debugging, print statements can be used for quick and temporary output to inspect variable values or track the flow of execution. However, as the codebase grows, replacing print statements with proper logging becomes necessary to manage and analyze logs effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Error Handling and Monitoring: In a real-world application, logging is crucial for error handling, monitoring, and troubleshooting. With proper log levels and output destinations, logging can capture important information about the application's behavior, errors, and performance in different environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Production Environments: print statements are not suitable for production environments because they can clutter the output and may expose sensitive information to users. In production, logging with appropriate log levels ensures that only relevant information is recorded, and log messages can be sent to designated log files or services for analysis and monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, while print statements are convenient for quick debugging and small scripts, the logging module is a more robust and controlled approach for handling log messages in real-world applications. It allows you to manage logs more effectively, control the output destination, and customize the log format based on your application's requirements.\n",
